EFFICIENT LIFELONG LEARNING ALGORITHM (ELLA)

BUILDING

The ELLA code is written in pure matlab and thus does not need to be built.
However, ELLA does have a dependency on the Sparse Additive Modeling Toolbox of
Julien Mairal et al. (http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/).  In order to use
ELLA one must first go to the subdirectory 'externalLibs/spams-matlab' and
follow the instructions for building this toolbox.



RUNNING THE CODE

We have included three demos for utilizing the different aspects of the ELLA
software.  The demo files are called:
	(1) runExperiment
	(2) runExperimentActiveTask
	(3) runExperimentActiveTaskTargeted

DATA

This release includes the landmine data set for use by the demonstration scripts. 
The landmine data was originally described in:

Xue, Y., Liao, X., Carin, L., & Krishnapuram, B. (2007). Multi-task learning for classification with Dirichlet process priors. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 8, 35-63.

Please cite this paper if you use the landmine data set in your own work.
